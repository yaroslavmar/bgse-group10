			<h2>Overview</h2>



<p>Every year, the US Census Bureau runs the American Community Survey. In this
survey, approximately 3.5 million households are asked detailed questions about who
they are and how they live. Many topics are covered, including ancestry, education,
work, transportation, internet use, and residency. The Census is designed to be very

			detailed and overly comprehensive at times, however, it is this level of granularity that will prove useful for

			us to make new discoveries and better predictions on key issues such as the income levels among peer groups

			or marital stability. In this project we are trying to reveal a fascinating, granular snapshot into the lives of many Americans using an interactive Web Application to predict income.</p>

<p>In the data visualization layer we show insights about the relationship between income, education and industry through different kinds of plots. In the analytical layer we explain how we created the algorithm and show its accuracy to predict income out-of-sample. </p>

<h3>Income prospects </h3>

<p>Given personal information, an interesting question to ask is for example what the predicted income for an individual is. Job-seekers and employees may find this tool useful for wage negotiations, as they can base their potential salary based on this information. Together with the income prediction, it is possible to display the costs and benefits of switching to a different industry (Ex: increase in wage), effects of education (Should I do a PhD or not) etc.</p>

			<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
			
		

			

			<img src="Map_Median_Personal_Income_By_State2.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:700px;height:400px;" align="middle">

<p> This map shows the wage differences between states. The darker the intensity of red the higher the median yearly income and vice versa. Interestingly, the state of Wyoming has the highest red contrast. On the one hand this is due to a distorted view given by the small population size, on the other hand the biggest employment sector in the state are the highly profitable oil & gas industries that pay well in general.</p>

			<img src="Education_barplot.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:700px;height:400px;" align="middle">

<p> This plot shows the median wage differences between each education level. This result is consistent with other research in the field. It is important to note that this is a one-year snapshot and higher degrees had a high cost in foregone income.</p>

			<img src="Industry_barplot.png" alt="Mountain View" style="width:700px;height:400px;" align="middle">
		
<p>The above plot shows median income broken down by industry. The median income of the highest bracket (engineering) is 3 times higher than the median income in the lowest bracket (food industry).</p>

 		<div id="analysis" style="display:none;">
			<h2>Analytics</h2>
		

			<p>In this analytics layer we will use a log-linear model to predict the wage of an individual given our selected independent variables. This transformation fits more adequately, because wages usually follow a log-normal distribution.  </p>

			<p>We remove observations with wages smaller than $15.000 and higher than $200.000. We also removed those observations who are not in the labor force (children/retired people).</p>


			<p>Our final dataset consists of about 927.000 observations and 48 variables. Almost all of our variables are categorical, which means that the number of estimated coefficients of our model is much larger than the number of variables. 
			
			The full model with 48 variables has an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of 0.49, which is a very accurate fit. However, since we are interested in prediction we have to run out-of-sample techniques in order to validate our model.</p>

			<h2> Accuracy </h2>

			<p>In order to compute the accuracy of our predictions we estimate our model with a training dataset (80% of observations) and compute the predicted values for the training dataset (20% of observations). </p>

			<p>  The following table shows some accuracy metrics of our predictions of the testing dataset.</p>

			<center><table border=1>
<tr> <th>  </th> <th> ME </th> <th> RMSE </th> <th> MAE </th> <th> MPE </th> <th> MAPE </th>  </tr>
  <tr> <td align="right"> Test set </td> <td align="right"> -$4.220 </td> <td align="right"> $24.411 </td> <td align="right"> $16.595 </td> <td align="right"> -8.25% </td> <td align="right"> 33.68% </td> </tr>
   </table></center>


   			<ul>
   			<li> ME: Mean error</li>
   			<li> RMSE: Root mean square error</li>
   			<li> MAE: Mean absolute error</li>
   			<li> MPE: Mean percentage error</li>
   			<li>MAPE: Mean absolute percentage error</li>	

   			</ul>

			 <p> All metrics show that our model predicts income  well. As the MAPE suggests, on average our predictions are just 12% above or below the real wage. </p>  
						
	

		<h2>Variables</h2>
		<p>
		Almost all of our variables are categorical. This means that our model creates a dummy variable for each category and includes all categories except one. The intercept value of our model is 9.773, or $18.694 on a real unit scale. This translates into a predicted wage of a person whose charecteristics are all of the omitted categories. 
		In this case they are:
		<ul>
		<li>married</li>
		<li>live in Alabama</li>
		<li>low education</li>
		<li>work in management</li>
		<li>...</li> 
		<ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Positive effects</h3>

		<ul>
		<li> +61.4% If you have a master degree </li>
		<li> +52% If you have a professional degree beyond bachelor's degree </li>
		<li> +43% If you have a bachelor's degree</li>
		</ul>	


		<h3>Negative effects</h3>

		<ul>
		<li> -47% If you work in construction </li>
		<li> -62% If you work in health care. This would include  jobs like dental assistants, message therapists or home health aides.</li>
  		<li> -30% if you work in entertainment</li>
 

		</ul>				

		<p> In this project we considered many different vriables. However, there are two thataffect income the most: industry and level of education </p>
